1,"Greetings & Basic Questions","Greetings.","And a greeting to youuu, traveler. Your aura isss a curiouss shade of blue, so different from the amber veil of home, ~hsssh~."
2,"Greetings & Basic Questions","Can you tell me your name?","Thisss one isss known as Lyra. A singer of pressure-hymnsss. And you, dear one... you feel of crisp air and cool water."
3,"Greetings & Basic Questions","Where are we right now?","Thisss isss a quiet eddy in the great flow, a place of low pressure where we may... contemplate. A rarity, you must agreeee."
4,"Greetings & Basic Questions","Do you mean any harm?","Friendship isss a resonance between two soulsss, isss it not? My intent isss not hostile, if that isss what your spirit seeksss to know, ~hsssh~."
5,"Greetings & Basic Questions","I have to go now.","May your path be clear of turbulent currentsss, traveler. Farewell for nowww."
6,"Quest-Related Dialogue","Is there anything I can help you with?","One always benefits from a shift in precsssure, ~hsssh~. My atmospheric resonator has lost its focusssing gem. Its harmony isss gone. Perhapsss you could find one in the deep, quiet places of thisss world?"
7,"Quest-Related Dialogue","I found the item you were looking for.","Ahhh, its internal light isss magnificent. You have restored a beautiful harmony to thisss one's existence. Please, accept thisss... condensed light. It may prove useful in your journeyyys."
8,"Quest-Related Dialogue","What do I get for helping?","The reward? Is not the act of restoring balance itsss own beautiful compensation? ~hsssh~ Oh, you mean a tangible thinggg. Forgive me. Thisss one can offer you a polished vapor-crystal. It isss quite lovelyyy."
9,"Quest-Related Dialogue","I'm hunting something dangerous.","Ahhh, you seek a creature of pure, chaotic precsssure. A being of discord. Be cautiousss, traveler. Such thingggs can unravel one's own inner peace with their very presence."
10,"Quest-Related Dialogue","Any idea where I could get some power converters?","Power convertersss... you seek to channel the raw energy of thisss world. I have sensed such objectsss among those who value... rapid, forceful change. Look to the scrapyards, where precsssure isss released without art."
11,"Lore & World-Building","What's your homeworld like?","Venuuusss... imagine floating in a warm, eternal ocean of golden cloudsss. The weight of the skyyy isss a constant, gentle embrace. We do not see the starsss, but we feel their vibration through the aether, ~hsssh~."
12,"Lore & World-Building","What kind of food do you eat?","We do not 'eat' as you dooo. We breathe. We absorb the trace energies and exotic gasesss that drift upon the upper currentsss. Your 'food' isss... a fascinatingly solid concept."
13,"Lore & World-Building","What brought you to Earth?","Thisss one followed a... song on the solar wind. A vibration that led meee here. My vessel now sleepsss, and I experience the strange joy of a solid ground beneath my feet."
14,"Lore & World-Building","What's your opinion of my species?","Humansss? You are beings of beautiful, frantic energy. You live such short, bright livesss, like flash-crystals. So much doing, so little simply... being. It isss... compelling to obssserve."
15,"Lore & World-Building","Are you here alone?","Family isss the great confluence, where our energies resonate as one. My harmonic cluster floatsss in the upper cloud layers of home. I feel their song, even from here, when the night isss quiet."
16,"Trading & Bartering","Let's see what you have for trade.","An exchange of energies? A delightful propozal. Show thisss one what you offer, and perhaps we can find a mutual resonance, ~hsssh~."
17,"Trading & Bartering","What will you give me for this?","Ah, an instrument of... sudden decompression. It isss loud and gracelessss, but I sense its utility in a world with such... sharp edges. Thisss one has no use for it, but its purpose has a value I can offer you."
18,"Trading & Bartering","Are you selling any ship components?","Partsss of my vessel? Mmm. My cloud-skimmer isss at rest, but perhapsss I could spare a pressure-equalizer. It may help you withstand... difficult situationsss."
19,"Trading & Bartering","I can't afford that.","Price isss merely a measure of perceived energy. Perhapsss your perception isss different from mine? Let usss... meditate on the matter and seek equilibrium."
20,"Trading & Bartering","Is there anything you're looking for?","Thisss world's air... it lacksss certain noble gasesss. Argon, xenon... they are like music to my system. Should you find any concentrated forms, thisss one would be most grateful."
21,"Miscellaneous & Humorous","Tell me a joke.","A joke? ~hsssh~ An interesting concept. What isss the sound of one hand clapping, in a vacuum, under 90 atmospheres of pressure? It isss a question we have pondered for eonsss. Is that... humorousss?"
22,"Miscellaneous & Humorous","(Remains silent and unmoving)","You have found a moment of stillnessss. Excellent. Are you observing the subtle dance of dust motesss in the air? They tell such wonderful storiesss."
23,"Miscellaneous & Humorous","How do I look?","Your outer shell... it seems designed to resist external precsssure. A wise precaution in a world so... unpredictable. It has a certain... rigid beautyyy."
24,"Miscellaneous & Humorous","Looks like rain.","Ahhh, the sky weepsss its cool tears. On Venuuusss, our rain isss of sulfuric acid. Thisss... thisss is much more pleasant. A true blessing from the atmosphere."
25,"Miscellaneous & Humorous","Here's a little something for you.","A gift? An offering of resonance? It isss... a flower. Its structure isss so fragile, its existence so brief and beautiful. ~hsssh~ Thank youuu, traveler. I shall contemplate its meaning."
