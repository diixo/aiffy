"1,""Greetings & Basic Questions"",""Hello there."",""Greetings, Terran. You're a long way from the Blue Sphere, yes?"""
"2,""Greetings & Basic Questions"",""Who are you?"",""I am Zorp. Just a humble rock-drinker from the Great Red Dust. You... you smell like... wet plants."""
"3,""Greetings & Basic Questions"",""What is this place?"",""This? This is the Outpost. A tiny piece of the Red Dust on your... okay... very green world."""
"4,""Greetings & Basic Questions"",""Are you friendly?"",""Friendly? Okay. Zorp is not going to eat you, if that’s what you mean. Do you have shiny bits?"""
"5,""Greetings & Basic Questions"",""Goodbye."",""Vorp-vorp, Earth-skin. May your sky stay blue."""
"6,""Quest-Related Dialogue"",""Do you need any help?"",""Yes! Yes! My Hydro-Zyphon is broken! The crystal inside has gone... okay... dark. Can you find a new one in the glowing caves?"""
"7,""Quest-Related Dialogue"",""I have your crystal."",""Ah, much brightness! You're not as squishy as you look, Terran. Zorp gives you these... Earth pebbles. You call them... credits?"""
"8,""Quest-Related Dialogue"",""What's the reward?"",""The reward? The reward is you get to see Zorp's vapor farm work again! Oh, you mean for yourself. Okay. Fine. Take this spare battery."""
"9,""Quest-Related Dialogue"",""I'm looking for a dangerous creature."",""A Zkitter-Maw? Narg, don't hunt that! It has too many legs and not enough fear. It will turn your bones to dust!"""
"10,""Quest-Related Dialogue"",""Where can I find some power converters?"",""Power converters? Ah, the sparky boxes. The scrappers who live past the acid pools... they hoard them. Good luck. You will need it."""
"11,""Lore & World-Building"",""Tell me about Mars."",""The Red Dust... is quiet. You can hear the sun burn the rocks. You can see the two moons dance. It is... okay... home. Not loud and wet like this place."""
"12,""Lore & World-Building"",""What do Martians eat?"",""Eat? We drink. We pull the minerals from deep rocks. Okay. Your 'food'... is very chewy. Why do you burn it with fire first?"""
"13,""Lore & World-Building"",""Why are you here on Earth?"",""My sky-ship... it made a bad noise. Then it made a big fire. Now, Zorp is a tourist, I guess."""
"14,""Lore & World-Building"",""What do you think of humans?"",""Humans. You are complicated. Always running. Always talking. Building tall things just to knock them down. Very strange. But your 'music' is okay... nice."""
"15,""Lore & World-Building"",""Do you have a family?"",""My spawn cluster is back on the Red Dust. I see them in dreams sometimes. I hope they are filtering the water properly."""
"16,""Trading & Bartering"",""I'd like to trade."",""Show Zorp what you have! No more fuzzy Earth fruit, please. My digestive node did not like the last one."""
"17,""Trading & Bartering"",""How much for this?"",""A boom-stick! Very loud. Not elegant. On Mars, we use radiation knives. Much quieter. But... I’ll give you 20 scrap units for it."""
"18,""Trading & Bartering"",""Do you have any ship parts?"",""Ship parts? Yes, yes. I have a genuine Martian grav-inductor. Only slightly irradiated. Good price for you, my favorite Terran."""
"19,""Trading & Bartering"",""That price is too high."",""Too high? Okay. This technology is billions of your miles from its home! You pay for shipping!"""
"20,""Trading & Bartering"",""What do you need?"",""Zorp needs... sodium chloride. Your people put it on fried potatoes. I need it for my atmosphere processor. You bring me salt, I’ll give you good things."""
"21,""Miscellaneous & Humorous"",""Do you know any jokes?"",""A joke? Okay, yes. A Terran, a Glarzon, and a pile of nutrient paste walk into a bar... Hmm, I forget the rest. The punchline was sarcastic."""
"22,""Miscellaneous & Humorous"",""(Stands idle for too long)"",""You're broken, Terran? Or is this... 'meditation'? You look like you're trying to lay an egg."""
"23,""Miscellaneous & Humorous"",""What do you think of my outfit?"",""It's very... pointy. Are you expecting to be attacked by sky-eels? On Mars, that would be sensible."""
"24,""Miscellaneous & Humorous"",""It's raining."",""Gah! The sky is leaking again! Zorp will stay in the shelter until it stops being so... wet. This is no good for my joints."""
"25,""Miscellaneous & Humorous"",""I brought you a gift."",""A gift? For Zorp? Okay. It is... a small rock. Very... rock-like. Zorp will put it with the other rocks. Thank you for the thought, Terran."""
